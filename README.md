# hamro-ride
A modular, mobile-ready ride-hailing backend built with Spring Boot 3, Java 17, PostgreSQL, and Redis. It allows drivers and passengers to register, manage profiles, and book rides in real time. The system follows a microservice-ready architecture, starting as a monolithic backend and easily extendable for future mobile apps and cloud deployment.
